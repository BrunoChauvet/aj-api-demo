I know my son far too well to... he would never do anything like that. He would never provoke anyone to do anything to him and he wouldn't do anything to anybody...,\" McSpadden said in a separate interview on CBS television.</p>\r\n<p>His father, Michael Brown Sr, said on NBC he felt the officer's version of events was \"crazy.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"For one, my son, he respected law enforcement,\" Brown said. \"Two, who in their right mind would rush or charge at a police officer that has his gun drawn? It sounds crazy.\"</p>\r\n<p>The parents' attorney also rejected Wilson's description of Brown.</p>\r\n<p>\"When you have people of colour be killed they try to demonise and play on the stereotypes, and they try to put the police officer who killed our children on a pedestal,\" Benjamin Crump told NBC. \"It's just not right, and we have to fix this system.\"</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Nationwide rallies</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Protests have flared across the United States after Monday's decision by a grand jury not to prosecute the white police officer for shooting dead the unarmed black teenager.</p>\r\n<p>One of the protest marches on Wednesday included about 200 people who began with a mock trial of Darren Wilson. Later an undetermined number of protesters made it into the City Hall in St Louis shouting \"Shame, shame\".</p>\r\n<p>More than 100 additional police officers were called to the building and it was locked down.</p>\r\n<p>A total of 58 people were arrested at area protests overnight, including 45 in Ferguson.</p>\r\n<p>Country music star Garth Brooks has cancelled scheduled appearances this week, saying it would be in poor taste to promote his comeback album in the midst of the national protests.</p>\r\n<p>\"To spend the day promoting our stuff like nothing was wrong, seemed distasteful to me,\" Brooks said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Missouri governor, Jay Nixon, ordered more than 2,200 National Guardsmen troops to the region near Ferguson rocked by rioting.</p>"

Indeed they are so prolific that a survey carried out in Nigeria earlier this year found that more than 50 percent of the population had received 'treatment' from the quacks at one time or another – even people with very serious diseases such as typhoid and malaria.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Professor Alex Dodoo, who monitors patient safety for the World Health Organisation in West Africa and has dealt with quacks for years points out the obvious dangers of dealing with fake doctors:</p>\r\n<p>\"If one is not licensed by the state, anything that one does is illegal. Going to see them is dangerous. Period. Would you sit in an aeroplane where the pilot says 'OK hello, I'm the pilot, but I've not been licensed!' No way! You put your health at risk and you can die.\"</p>\r\n<p>But it is something that has long bothered Rosemary Nwaebuni, a reporter who lives and works in Nigeria's Delta State. She has encountered many people who have suffered at the hands of fake doctors, particularly women who have been the victim of botched abortions, and she is frustrated that the authorities have not done more to stamp them out.</p>\r\n<p>For this this episode of <em>Africa Investigates</em>, she joined up with Anas Aremeryaw Anas, an award-winning journalist from Ghana, to track down the quacks and gather evidence of their scams.</p>\r\n<p>The duo's eye-opening investigation quickly unearthed a host of 'doctors' and 'nurses' using forged and fake qualifications and with little or no medical training.</p>\r\n<p>The premises these fake medics operate from are invariably unsanitary and the manifestly phoney 'treatments' they offer patients risk ending in blindness, poisoning, perforated wombs and even life-threatening disfigurement and death from surgical procedures carried out by people lacking even a modicum of skill or experience. Others fall victim to the quacks' complete inability to diagnose even the most obvious diseases and conditions; mistakes that are more likely to kill or injure their patients than they ever are to heal them.</p>\r\n<p>Going undercover in the guise of a patient, Rosemary was offered treatment for typhoid and malaria (even though she is perfectly healthy) and an illegal abortion (even though she is not pregnant) by quacks who had no medical qualifications whatsoever but who pretended to be experienced and licensed practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>In one remarkable sting, the <em>Africa Investigates</em> team rented a house and invited local quacks to come and do 'home visits'. The 'patient' was again Rosemary, who – with the help of a qualified medic – had learned some symptoms that any genuine doctor would immediately recognise as indications of heart disease. Instead, one after another, the 'quacks' turned up and after cursory examinations wrongly claimed that Rosemary was suffering from typhoid and malaria (two commonly cited conditions) for which she need expensive drugs that only they could prescribe.</p>\r\n<p>What the fake doctors did not know was that the house was rigged with secret closed circuit cameras and that their every move was being scrutinised by a genuine medical practitioner. The doctor was local to the area and asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, but he was unequivocal in his condemnation of the fakes.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is absolute quackery,\" he said of one of the fakes. \"All he did was just glance at the patient and then made a diagnosis and prescribed medications … To take all barrage of medications for this patient with malaria and typhoid. This is wrong, this is all wrong. These drugs are poison. They cause real damage.\"</p>\r\n<p>The team took this this and other evidence to Dr Alfred Ebiakofa, a senior medical officer working for the Nigerian Ministry of Health. He had always lacked the resources and proof to go after fake doctors but now was able to act. He called in the police to work with Anas who, as the investigation heads to a climax, devised a dramatic scheme to trap one of Nigeria's most notorious quacks in the act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch more <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/\"><em>Africa Investigates</em></a> for reports by undercover African journalists who face intimidation, beatings and death threats.</p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p>Legend has it that while a fire destroyed the city of Rome, the emperor Nero played his fiddle; he was merrily ignoring the plight of his people. This weekend, it seemed to be Kenya's turn to get a taste of what official neglect and disinterest look like. As 28 Kenyans lay dead, murdered in cold-blood by terrorists, President Uhuru Kenyatta was wining and dining with the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201411250310.html\" target=\"_blank\">jet set in Abu Dhabi</a>, enjoying the trapping of a Formula 1 weekend.</p>\r\n<p>But things are not always as they seem. The fact is, it is not that Kenyatta's government was disinterested in security. It is that its understanding of what constitutes a national security threat is radically different from what most Kenyans would expect.</p>\r\n<p>The events immediately preceding and following the massacre of bus passengers in the town of Mandera, near Kenya's border with Somalia, have amply demonstrated why Kenya's security is in the toilet. Days before the atrocity happened, county government officials had been <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2014/11/18/feature-01\" target=\"_blank\">warning of the threat of an attack</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have strong intelligence which we have shared with security authorities, but we are disappointed that the authorities are not taking us seriously,\" Mandera County Governor Ali Roba complained.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>Policing, not protecting</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Instead of reinforcing security at the border town, the government dispatched officers to the Kenyan coast, where a series of raids on several mosques had apparently turned up a small cache of weapons including pistols, grenades and petrol bombs. More than 360 people had been arrested in the night-time raids, including some as young as 12, with many claiming to have been taken from their homes. As a result, according to one report, at the time the Mandera attack happened, \"<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/-/1056/2532898/-/15rhwriz/-/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">there were only four officers in the area</a>\".</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>It is not difficult to guess why police would be withdrawn from an area under imminent threat of terrorist attack to one where the government had just closed several mosques, arrested and alienated huge numbers of people and where attacks on non-Muslim communities had already been carried out. The problem the authorities are concerned about is not the external one from the Somalia-based armed group, al-Shabab, but rather the internal one from disaffected, disillusioned and radicalised citizens.</p>\r\n<p>The government has tended to deal with the citizenry as the primary source of national security threat, which it defines as the threat to itself and to its authority, not to the people. It thus has shown no compunction about demonising entire communities, from Somali refugees and citizens of Somali origin, to Muslims, to the marginalised communities across the north and in the west of the country.</p>\r\n<p>From their founding, the Kenyan security institutions have been set up to police, not to protect local communities. The security system is a colonial era edifice that has not been fundamentally reformed and continues to prioritise the protection of the rapacious interests of a tiny and powerful elite over the rights and safety of the rest of the country. These elites have actively resisted any attempt to reform the system. They have actively sought to undermine the 2010 constitution which enshrined a bill of rights and articulated a new security structure.</p>\r\n<p>Laws reforming the security structure, when they have been passed, have either been ignored, or amended so as to detract from their original purpose. There have there been legislative moves to turn oversight bodies into mere paperweights, which would only confirm the reality that they are ignored anyway. For example, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority has noted gaps in the implementation of legislation meant to streamline the National Police Service and demanded the resignation of the inspector general of police over the inability to deal with insecurity, but it now <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/campus/story/2000139914/police-officers-want-bully-watchdog-shown-the-door\" target=\"_blank\">finds itself threatened with dissolution</a>.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i>'A personal challenge'</i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>The result of this is that the elite have continued to have a free hand to exploit the resources of the country at the expense of its population. Kenya's elephant and rhino populations are being hunted to extinction while the government protects those most responsible for the carnage. The country has been turned into a major conduit for illegal drugs and <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.trust.org/item/20131209150854-1kirf/?source=spotlight\" target=\"_blank\">a destination for illicit money</a>. Further, it has fallen to the international community to step into the breach created by the inaction of Kenyan authorities and to attempt to prosecute some of those responsible for the mass murder of Kenyans, as well as the corruption that impoverishes them. Predictably, such moves have been met with either foot-dragging or outright opposition from the government.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>It is plain that a government run by people who see the rest of the populace as a threat to their position and to their opportunities to extract rents, will not be too motivated to protect them. In fact, Kenyatta's administration has tended to treat insecurity not as a security threat, but a public relations problem. The government has, for example, been slow to respond to the widespread incidents of violence against women, with half-hearted reactions when public outrage over incidents of women being assaulted and stripped in public made the news.</p>\r\n<p>Terrorist attacks have inspired little other than strong words and perplexing declarations of victory (such as we heard after the attack on the Westgate Mall) and sometimes, outright lies. In the aftermath of the attacks on Mpeketoni, near the coastal town of Lamu, the president got into <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/africa/kenya-mpeketoni-attack-who-fooling-who\" target=\"_blank\">an unseemly tussle with al-Shabab</a> whose claim of responsibility had complicated his own efforts to lay the blame on \"local political networks\", which is shorthand for the opposition.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement issued on behalf of the president following the Mandera attack, Deputy President William Ruto was quick to congratulate the security forces for protecting Kenyans (go figure!) and, without offering any proof, repeat claims that many other attacks had been stopped and that in the particular case of the Mandera attackers, the security forces had caught up with them and killed 100 of them. As evidence for the latter, the government appeared to have released pictures bearing a time stamp from two years ago.</p>\r\n<p>An address to a high level security seminar given by the president just hours before the killing of 22 officers illustrates his propensity to see national security purely through the prism of his own \"personal challenge\" as he once described his prosecution at the International Criminal Court. It is peppered with references to the fight against foreign domination and demonises civil society organisations, which have pushed for his case not to be prematurely abandoned.</p>\r\n<p>So when informed of the attack in Mandera, Kenyatta did not think it prudent to skip the Formula 1 race and dash home to deal with the security crisis simply because he does not consider the murder of Kenyans a security crisis. The problem is not that he is fiddling while Kenya burns. It is rather that despite all evidence to the contrary, he does not think that Kenya is burning.</p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Patrick Gathara is a strategic communications consultant, writer, and award-winning political cartoonist based in Nairobi. </i></STRONG></em></p>"

Children</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">'</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">s clothes dry in the bathroom and packets of wet wipes and bottles of medicine are scattered about. The room feels lived in - and it has been.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since mid-August, Proshunina has been staying here in the Katerina, a small truck stop motel on the southern edge of Lviv, in western Ukraine that now houses about 55 people displaced by fighting in <span>Ukraine's</span> east. But this is only her most recent stop after they fled.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In her struggles Proshunina has become one of nearly 473,000 Ukrainians who have been dispersed across the country as internally displaced persons (IDPs), according to numbers released on Friday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This is up from 275,000 just two months ago.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In June, Proshunina fled fighting in her small village in Luhansk province, one of two separatist regions in Ukraine's east.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"There was a lot of shooting in the village, then Russian troops came in. Then we fled to another village. We spent a night there and the next day they started shooting rockets and shells,\" says Proshunina, 31. She and many others fled by bus to the capital Kiev.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">No time to cry</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bouncing between the apartments of family and friends, Emin was born in Kiev on July 21. He never met his father. Proshunina's husband, Sergey, a Ukrainian national guardsman, was killed in the massacre at Ilovaisk at the end of August.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His parents, who live in Russia and are pro-Russian, blame her for his death. They will not give her his documents, and so she cannot collect compensation from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. Her documents were accidentally left behind when she fled the fighting. Without her passport, she says, she has not been able to register for social services support for Dmitry and Emin.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"I don't have time to cry, I have to take care of my two kids,\" she says, continuing to nurse Emin, who has clubfoot in both legs and requires casts now and will need special shoes for years to come. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"The government must help me, but I have no hope that they will.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Right now she is getting by on instant noodles, free food for her children, and the room at the Katerina provided to the IDPs by the owner, a local businessman. Some 300 to 400 displaced people have already passed through its darkened hallways, estimates Oleg Kolyasa, a volunteer with Civil Sector, an umbrella organisation of Ukrainian NGOs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is a \"typical example\", says Oldrich Andrysek, the UNHCR's regional representative. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"If the businessman didn't do this, these people would end up living under a bridge,\" he says. \"In general, the situation is getting worse in terms of numbers. The winter will complicate matters further.\" He says that although the government is under pressure to provide assistance, it has not been able to come through. \"The lion's share of assistance still comes from volunteers and civil society groups,\" he says.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><STRONG><i>Growing a<span>nimosity </span></i></STRONG></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Indeed, though Proshunina's may be the most desperate, each room in the Katerina - said to usually cater to prostitutes and truckers heading to nearby Poland - houses a sad story of loss and displacement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Down the hall, Natalya Yagolovich shares a room with her two sons. They fled Donetsk when the chemical factory on the edge of the city blew up. \"I've been afraid for a long time, but now you can't even go outside,\" she says.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Her husband stayed behind to work, and volunteers promised to meet her at the train station when she came to Lviv, a city where her oldest son plans to continue his education in computer programming. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"When we arrived, no one was at the station. I've never been here before, and I had no idea where to go.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They ended up at the Katerina. When she went to the government's social services office to register for benefits for her youngest - a little more than $25 a month - she was told, \"We don't have to give you anything. Go rent a flat yourself,\" she says.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A lieutenant in the state's prison system, she says she cannot get a job because her work documents are at the headquarters in Donetsk, which has been taken over by rebels. And there are other problems. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"When potential employers figure out that we are IDPs they don't want to take us on because they know that we will leave at some point. Also, there is the fact that some of the locals have their kids fighting in the east and we are living here, and they have bad feelings towards us,\" she says.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yagolovich's situation highlights a key problem faced by IDPs. \"There may be increasing animosity against those who were forced to flee,\" says the UNHCR's Andrysek. \"The social repercussions are endless. We have to help these people get on their own two feet, otherwise they will be perceived as eating from the common pie but not contributing anything back.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is also the risk that prolonged assistance could lead to dependence and lack of work could lead to marginalisation, he says. In turn, this could cause IDPs to become embittered and return to the war torn east, either living in squalor or possibly arming themselves and fighting against the government.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"It is better to go back there and die than to be here and suffer,\" says Yagolovich. \"Our future is not clear. We have no choices, and no one from the government is giving us any.\"</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"mceVideoBox\" style=\"width: 330; height: 186; float: Left;\">\r\n<div id=\"bc_3906257883001\" style=\"width: 330; height: 186;\"><!-- --></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> <STRONG><i><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">No budget for IDPs</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Undeniably, Kiev has been overwhelmed by the scale of the humanitarian crisis, and has been slow to react. Partially, this is because Ukraine is broke and deeply in debt. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"The question of IDPs is a big issue that will require a lot of financial support, but the government is not hurrying to sign a bill because there is no money in the budget,\" says Serhiy Kiral, the head of investment for the Lviv city council.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even without money though, the government has only just signed its first legislation on internally displaced persons, seven months into the conflict. Now people can register specifically as IDPs, not just through pension or child benefit lists. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"The first important steps were taken only four weeks ago,\" laments UNHCR's Andrysek, adding a new law on IDPs has been signed and should enter into force soon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But, with almost half a million people displaced by the fighting, the problems Kiev faces are nearly overwhelming. Among a litany of issues, Andrysek says the government has not yet even created a central authority to govern the problem, and that administrative mechanisms are lacking.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"The government was obviously not prepared for such a large wave of internally displaced people,\" he says. \"It is a problem in the making and it is still growing.\" While he acknowledges that the government has taken some steps, he says: \"It has a long way to go to solving the underlying key issues, and more are looming.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The easiest way to solve all of this is if everyone could just go home - the wish voiced again and again by everyone Al Jazeera spoke to. But with fighting continuing in the east and more Russian troops entering the fray, that looks unlikely to happen now or anytime soon.</span> </p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><STRONG><i><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/ukraine-vote-view-from-war-torn-east-20141027172054185136.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">RELATED: </span>Ukraine vote: A view from the war-torn east</span></a></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sitting in the hotel room with her two boys and the memory of her husband, Proshunina leans over her youngest son, his legs kicking in their casts, and sweetly coos to him. </span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"We will have to do everything ourselves, isn't that right?\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">If the government does not enact legislation soon, she and hundreds of thousands of others may just well have to. </span></p>"

We meet her mother and teenage son - two people not only from different generations, but from different worlds, from Siberian labour camps to designer clothes and computer games. And in between them stands Ruka herself - who doesn’t want to let go of the security of her job as a cleaner despite her brilliant career as a photographer.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em>The Photographer from Riga</em> can be seen from<STRONG><i> <STRONG><i>Wednesday, December 3<STRONG><i> <STRONG><i><STRONG><i><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>at the following times GMT: Wednesday: 2000; Thursday: 1200; Friday: 0100; Saturday: 0600.</i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Across Latin America the impact of poverty and climate change are bringing greater stress to rural communities. In arid northern Argentina, people have only one source of fuel; wood. It is often scrawny bushes that are increasingly hard to find. But the region also has a huge untapped resource – solar radiation – and Virginia Bauso’s mission is to harness its potential and promote solar energy as the main power source for entire villages: from kitchens and ovens to heating, lighting, hot water and even a public phone.</p>\r\n<p>She roams the desert spreading innovative technology, including a “kiosk” she invented that cooks food using the sun’s rays. The community of Misa Rumi is now almost 100 percent solar-functional. Another village recently built a solar quinoa dryer, creating new opportunities for employment.</p>\r\n<p>As deforestation and desertification continue to ravage Argentina and beyond, Bauso’s vision could play a major role in charting a sustainable path to energy independence. This film will explore how solar energy improves rural life on multiple levels by documenting its impact – in the fields of agriculture, education, health and business, as well as power – and contrasting this with isolated communities that are yet to adopt Bauso’s groundbreaking tools.</p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><em>Seizing Solar Power </em>can be seen from <STRONG><i><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>Sunday, <STRONG><i><STRONG><i>December 7 <STRONG><i><STRONG><i><STRONG><i>at the following times GMT: <STRONG><i><STRONG><i>Sunday: 2230; Monday: 0930; Tuesday: 0330 and Wednesday: 1630.</i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></i></STRONG></p>\r\n\r\n<p><STRONG><i></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Asmahan, a Syrian Druze princess, emerged as an Egyptian siren in the ‘40s.

Otilia Arellano has spent most of her 50 years living on these streets. Today though she is building a different way to live. She is the leader of a self sustaining group home where the otherwise homeless and destitute of Mexico's second largest city pool their meagre resources and their shared dreams to make a new life and build a new 'family'.</p>\r\n<p>In Mexico's Crossroads, we explore the day to day life inside this unique group home as the residents struggle to support themselves.

We join her story from shortly after she arrives until her daughter is able to attend school for the first time many months later. We witness their family struggle such as the pressing need to find a stable job and over having her children taken away by the authorities because they spend their days on the streets.

The <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.ifes.org/~http://www.aljazeera.com/media/Files/Publications/Survey/2013/Libya%20Status%20of%20Women%20Survey%20Report_final2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">majority of college graduates in the country are women</a>, with 77 percent pursuing higher education courses, compared to 63 percent of men, according to a September 2013 report by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES).</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/10/libya-war-nobody-can-win-2014101973131576935.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: 16px;\"> OPINION: Libya: The war nobody can win </span></a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>However, the problems seem to arise after graduation, with only 43 percent of women gaining official employment.</p>\r\n<p>\"The issue is not education, it's that following on from education, we have this drastic decrease where a lot of women are not entering the formal workforce,\" said Alaa Murabit from her home in Zawiyah, a city in northwest Libya.</p>\r\n<p>Murabit is the founder of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.vlwlibya.org/national-policies-on-ensuring-the-economic-empowerment-of-women-in-libya/\" target=\"_blank\"> The Voice of Libyan Women</a>, a non-profit organisation that works to improve political participation and economic empowerment for women.</p>\r\n<p>Murabit, a doctor, says there are a few reasons for this decrease, one of which is that many women choose to work from home in order to accommodate their families' needs.</p>\r\n<p>\"Most women will choose jobs that allow for them to have a family life - they will start at-home businesses. Those who start these businesses, where they are making sweets or have a sewing business, that's not seen as part of the formal economy; they are not officially part of the Libyan work force. And it's a large group of women who choose to work that way,\" explains Murabit.</p>\r\n<p>According to recent figures, only 20 percent of women in Libya take part in civic or political activity of any kind.</p>\r\n<p>Of Libya's working women, 73 percent choose careers in education or medicine. Hikmat Kmishi is the coordinator of Women for Democratic Transformation (WDT), a Tripoli-based network that encourages prospective female politicians. She affirmed that women tend to work in two main sectors.</p>\r\n<p>\"Most women become doctors or teachers. We certainly don't have many female politicians,\" explains Kmishi, who holds cultural factors responsible for this trend. </p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\"Women are not traditionally in the public sphere, and while they are given jobs, rarely are they put in decision-making positions. It's the mindset, people still think women can't do a lot.\"</p>\r\n<p>Kmishi is one of many women who think that cultural practices are negatively affecting the female workforce, and it's a factor that arises for Libyan women in various sectors.</p>\r\n<p>Assia Amry works for Aramex, a global logistics and transportation provider. She is the manager of their Tripoli branch. She grew up in the US but moved to Libya in June 2012 with her father, who had been part of an anti-Gaddafi dissident movement.</p>\r\n<p>\"My team are all men,\" says Amry. \"At first I think they were amused at the idea of being led by a woman, but [they] eventually accepted it … and it's great.\"</p>\r\n<p>Amry explained that while there are some women in managerial positions in Libya, senior roles are overwhelmingly awarded to men. As a result, female employees can at times be overlooked. \"The biggest challenge is with customers,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>\"A lot of times when customers have issues, they will say 'I want to talk to the manager,' but they don't realise I am the manager, and it's usually satisfying for me to tell them that.\"</p>\r\n<p>The number of women working in Libya's private sector is low at nine percent, but not necessarily because women are actively being discouraged to enter the work force, according to Amry.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's not because in Libyan culture, women are taught not to achieve, or work; I just think Libya, in all aspects, is evolving… Libyan women are go-getters, they are looking for opportunities.\"</p>\r\n<p>Beyond pre-existing social factors, Libya's ongoing political turmoil has restricted freedom of movement for women across the country and in turn, discouraged women from entering politics.</p>\r\n<p>Noor El Huda Gleasa, 23, is a communications manager for Creative International Associates, an NGO that facilitates voter education and promotes civic engagement.</p>\r\n<p>She works across 16 different cities in Libya. \"If a woman wants to work in politics or in a job that's in the spotlight, the security issues they face are much more severe than men,\" Gleasa told Al Jazeera. \"It puts women in an incredibly difficult position.\"</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, Hanan Salah, the Libya Researcher for Human Rights Watch, pointed out that the ongoing conflict and lack of security across the country is the main issue affecting Libyan women's ability to work.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> \"There have been several instances this past year where, due to the complete lack of law and order in parts of Libya, various militias and individuals are taking matters into their own hands by trying to prohibit women from travelling on their own without a male companion,\" Salah told Al Jazeera.</p>\r\n<p>\"Some militias have been harassing women on university campuses. We have examples of women who have been forced to stop their studies because of the impunity that these militias and individuals are benefiting from.\"</p>\r\n<p>In short, the instability that has spread across Libya means that women's basic physical access to employment has been affected and this impacts the careers they pursue.</p>\r\n<p>\"The reason a lot of women choose to be teachers isn't because they all had a particularly strong desire to be teachers, but it's because schools are everywhere and are easily accessible,\" Murabit said.</p>\r\n<p>\"For women who don't have a husband or brother who will drive them everywhere, it's very difficult for them to have a corporate job downtown, because they would need transportation and Libyan public transportation is very poor.\"</p>\r\n<p>Murabit said this issue could easily be solved if the Libyan government invested in safe public transportation for women as well as establishing more locally based occupations.</p>\r\n<p>\"There is a heavy reliance on what is a local and safe job, and these are primarily as educators, which is great for our future generations - but Libya now has an influx of teachers and not many women working in other fields.\"</p>\r\n<p>Women in Libya are now looking ahead to a new constitution that is currently being drafted by the parliament in Tripoli and is scheduled to be issued in December.</p>\r\n<p>While women's rights groups are pushing for a quota system to ensure they have a significant presence in the new parliament, the country's younger generation is determined to secure their place in Libya's future.</p>\r\n<p>\"I really hope the new constitution is up to our standards,\" said Gleasa. \"And if it's not, well, I know Libyan women won't stay quiet about it for long.\"</p>"

Wilson said that following the shots, a wounded Brown ran away from the vehicle, before charging at the police officer again.<br /> <br />Wilson said he was forced to shoot Brown multiple times as he was running towards the officer.<br /> <br />But analysts have questioned how such a severely wounded and unarmed Brown could have been such a threat to Wilson that he had to shoot him in the head numerous times.<br /> <br />\"Officer Wilson knows he is not armed. Even if a twice-shot bleeding Brown came running towards him again, why would he be threatened for his life?\" Bloom said.<br /> <br />\"Why would he have to shoot him in the head and kill him in that moment?\"</p>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">All of the discussions about Ferguson are going in circles. Nothing seems to work. We can make Twitter hashtags. We can bring up all the statistics we like. We can talk about the string of recent deaths of black men (and one <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/23/cleveland-police-shoot-dead-12-year-old-boy-carrying-fake-gun\" target=\"_blank\">12-year-old boy</a>). And in return, we are told to shut up. US social media is now full of angry white people who demand that we stop talking about racism.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But everyone seems to be missing the point, which I believe I have discovered: Black people are not <em>people</em>. They are not even three-fifths of a person, as some of us seem fond of saying. Blacks are apparently nothing more than fantasy creatures - demons, savages, comic book characters.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>We've seen this movie before</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>On Monday, a grand jury failed to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black boy. This was confirmed at 1 pm, but the information was </span><span>not released until 9 pm. Why did the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7279379/ferguson-grand-jury-timing\" target=\"_blank\">authorities wait until the evening</a> to announce the decision? Because they knew that crowd control is more difficult at night, and that night shots of fires and police/protester standoffs would be more dramatic than daytime ones? Were the lives of thousands - civilians and police alike - put at risk, all in the name of PR, because they needed a diversion?</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>In the end, they got what they wanted. A building caught fire, which gave news stations an excuse to run \"Ferguson in Flames\" headlines, to ignore thousands of peacefully protesting citizens to focus on looters, to report about police cars burning but ignore </span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://bpicampus.com/2014/11/25/morning-feature-bob-mccollouchs-riot/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>police scanner reports</span></a><span> that a main suspect was a white male.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Watching things play out in Ferguson has been like watching a bad movie after a friend spoils the plot for you. That is why in all of the articles that have come out after the verdict, there is none of the original urgency that we saw during the first weeks after the shooting. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>After all, we've all seen this one before, haven't we? White cop shoots black thug, black thugs riot, Al Sharpton says something, people forget, credits roll.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>So, it's no wonder non-Americans tend to think that real life in the US is just like it is in violent Hollywood movies - because it often is. But this doesn't mean that other countries have picked up our bad habit of frantically demonising blacks in the news. Watching foreign news treatment of Michael Brown is particularly illuminating. In Japan, newscasters call him \"Brown-san\", using the honorific suffix \"-san\" out of respect. In Mexican coverage, he's referred to as a \"joven\", in Brazil, a \"jovem\", in Taiwan, a \"xiaonian\" - all words for a \"young man\". In other words, he is treated as a person.</span></p>\r\n<p>But in the US, we are warned that <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28929087\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Brown \"<span>was no angel</span>\"</a>. We are told that he made rap songs. We are reminded that he was quite tall (just as tall as his killer), and a bit overweight (this part makes him scary). <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/was-michael-brown-enrolled-in-college/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News has worked to cast doubt</a> on whether he was headed to college or not. Any facade of humanity that Brown might have had has been stripped away, all the better to show us the terrifying monster within.<STRONG><i></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Killing our demons</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>In his testimony, Officer Darren Wilson, the man who shot Michael Brown, said of the victim that \"</span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/25/darren-wilson-testimony_n_6216620.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>it look[ed] like a demon</span></a>\"<span>. That is, not only was Brown a \"demon\", but an \"it\".</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Granted, Wilson may have misspoken. He probably meant \"he\" instead of \"it\". But, this is a man who has sworn to protect the lives of his fellow citizens. He has also had weeks to receive the finest media training available. This was, to put it neutrally, a very delicate case. If it did not occur to him or his handlers that referring to a dead boy as \"it\", \"a demon\", or \"the threat\" in public was a bad idea, does that not suggest that perhaps something might be wrong with the way Ferguson police interact with the citizenry?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>But none of this matters, because Michael Brown was not a person. He was a demon, and apparently, a comic book character.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>At another point in the testimony, Wilson said that Brown \"looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I'm shooting at him\". </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Nobody seems to know what \"bulking up\" even means. I've only heard it in terms of sports - athletes eat more and workout during the off-season so as to \"bulk up\" and be more muscular and competitive come game time. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>But \"bulking up\" isn't something that one instantaneously does after being shot once, nor in order to prepare to run through a hail of bullets. Really, this doesn't sound like a testimony, it sounds like the plot line of </span><span><em><span>The Incredible Hulk</span></em><span>.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>To be honest, Wilson's story doesn't make any sense to me</span><span>, but I'll never know the truth now, because the US was denied a trial. So, I'm afraid I have to agree with all of the racists. Perhaps whatever Wilson saw that day wasn't human. There might have been a human out there in the street, but Wilson didn't see him. He saw a demon, and it's hard to blame him, because that's all we seem to see.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span>Black people may be dying, but white activism isn't</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span>One common insult thrown at the youth of the US is that we are too apathetic, and not capable of starting a social movement. This is simply not true. Americans have not lost their ability to organise. Over the past few months, we have launched two rather impressive online-based movements: the Ice Bucket Challenge</span><span><a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a><span>, and GamerGate.</span><span> In the first, millions made viral videos of themselves pouring cold water over their heads to raise money to find a cure for a debilitating disease called ALS. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>In the second, a group of (<a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/stop-gamergate-hate-mob-pleads-4534231\" target=\"_blank\">largely misogynist</a>) </span><span>video game enthusiasts were able to get such multinational companies as Intel and Adobe to pull sponsorships from major technology media sites, all in the name of \"ethical journalism\". Both movements were predominantly white.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>But, I'm not sure if we should expect a widespread movement of white internet activists pushing companies to stop sponsoring biased real-life news programmes, or donating money to stop police brutality. In the latter case, we've actually seen the opposite - a <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.alternet.org/activism/pressure-grows-gofundme-stop-its-support-officer-darren-wilson-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">\"Support Darren Wilson\" campaign raised</a> <span>nearly a half million dollars</span><span>, with some contributors thanking Wilson for, among other things, \"protecting normal Americans from aggressive and entitled primitive savages\".</span></p>\r\n<p><span>After all, we live in an age where many Americans will gleefully dump ice water on their heads in front of a video camera, but become angry the moment someone brings up the possibility that Brown's case might have been mishandled. In other words, a sizable portion of the population would rather risk hypothermia, heart arrhythmia, and death than endure the emotional discomfort of considering blacks as humans.</span></p>\r\n<p>Instead, Americans prefer to consider blacks as fantasy characters, because this makes our expectations of them seem reasonable. We adore them as entertainers, but despise them as neighbours. We want them to sing loudly, but die quietly.</p>\r\n<p><span>Fifty years ago, a writer named James Baldwin said that Americans needed to recognise that the humanity of the \"submerged population\" of blacks was equal to the humanity of anyone else. I fear that Baldwin may have overestimated our sense of compassion and responsibility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>It may be too early, or too late, to think of the US race problem as whites being \"more\", and blacks being \"less\" human. I'm afraid that we may need to begin by deciding whether blacks are human at all.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i>Dexter Thomas, Jr is a scholar of hip-hop and contemporary culture at Cornell University.

Called 'The Great War' and the 'war to end all wars', it is often remembered for its grim and relentless trench warfare - with Europe seen as the main theatre of war.</p>\r\n<p>But this was a battle fought on many fronts. There is a story other than the mainstream European narrative. It is not told as often but was of huge importance during the war and of lasting significance afterwards. It is the story of the Arab troops who were forced to fight on both sides but whose contribution is often forgotten.</p>\r\n<p>They fought as conscripts for the European colonial powers occupying Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia - and for the Ottomans on the side of Germany and the Central Powers. The post-war settlement would also shape the Middle East for the next hundred years.</p>\r\n<p>In this three-part series, Tunisian writer and broadcaster Malek Triki explores the events surrounding World War One and its legacy from an Arab perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mceVideoBox\" style=\"width: 680; height: 413; float: Left;\">\r\n<div id=\"bc_3894581097001\" style=\"width: 680; height: 413;\"><!-- --></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><STRONG><i> <em> The story of Arab troops conscripted from North Africa and the Levant to fight on both sides of the Great War and their role in the Allied defeat at Gallipoli. </em> </i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p>Arabs troops from North Africa were among the first to be exposed to the Germans' poisonous gas soon after the start of World War One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some reports also suggest that they were subjected to the ancient Roman military practice of 'decimation'. This was the almost random execution of every tenth member of a unit for collective failures of army discipline - and the French are alleged to have used it against their North African troops. </p>\r\n<p>Galliopoli was one of the biggest Allied defeats of the war. But it is not well-known that as many as 300,000 of Mustafa Kamal's Ottoman forces in the campaign were Arabs from Greater Syria – present day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine.</p>\r\n<p>But the Ottoman entry into the war was accompanied by a call to jihad by the Grand Mufti in Istanbul to all Muslims across the world.</p>\r\n<p>Muslim was forced to fight against Muslim; and the German propaganda machine seized up the tension this created in the Arab world by seeking to undermine the morale of the north Africa troops fighting for the western Allies.</p>\r\n<p>It even set up a show camp near Zossen in Germany where Muslim troops were given preferential treatment in an attempt to persuade them to change sides. The Half Moon Camp was the site of the first ever mosque in Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mceVideoBox\" style=\"width: 680; height: 413; float: Left;\">\r\n<div id=\"bc_3906957676001\" style=\"width: 680; height: 413;\"><!-- --></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Episode two tells the story of the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the fall Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the rise of the young Turk government in his place - and the history of the Ottoman-Germany relationship which led to the Treaty of Alliance between them in August 1914.</p>\r\n<p>The war saw the rise of feelings of nationalism among the Arabs of North Africa and the Levant. But the Ottoman response was to crack down hard on the Arabs of Greater Syria – and many leading intellectuals were executed, sentenced to long jail terms or forced into exile under the authoritarian governorship of Jamal Pasha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Episode three covers the secret Sykes-Picot agreement between Britain and France and the way the two imperial powers carved up the former Ottoman Empire between them, regardless of the rights and demands of rights and nationalist movements across the Arab world.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the Egyptian Revolution and the Iraq Uprising, Arab subservience to Ottoman rule was replaced by a series of mandates across the region in which Britain and France seized control of the areas they prized most – to satisfy their own ambitions, interests and ultimately to gain access to region's valuable oil resources.</p>\r\n<p>The war gave birth to the Turkish nationalist movement which led to the founding of the modern Turkish state; and to Zionism, aided greatly by the Balfour Declaration of 1917. The Treaty of Versaillles, however, was referred to by one German-Ottoman military leader not as a peace but as 'a twenty year armistice' – and so it proved ...</p>\r\n<p><em> <STRONG><i> The New Middle East airs from December 2, 2014 </i></STRONG> </em></p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td><span style=\"font-size: 10px;\"> <em> World War One Through Arab Eyes </em>  is a three-part series that can be seen each week at the following times GMT: Tuesday: 2000; Wednesday: 1200; Thursday: 0100; Friday: 0600; Saturday: 2000; Sunday: 1200; Monday: 0100; Tuesday: 0600.  </span> <br /> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This weekend it was reported that two Britons, Jamie Read and James Hughes, the latter a former soldier, have joined a small band of foreigners fighting alongside the Yekineyen Parastina Gel (YPG). </span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The YPG, also known as the People's Protection Units, have been central to the defence of northern Syria against the encroachment of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">This perilous decision has seen them join other foreigners, including Americans and Canadians, who have separately taken the same decision to fight along the Kurdish militia. While the numbers of this group are still too small to be seen as part of a growing trend, their move will have been welcomed, if nothing else for publicity purposes, by the <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/kobane-explained-what-so-special-about-it-201410216033364111.html\" target=\"_blank\">besieged defenders of Kobane</a>.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">The news that there are foreign combatants on both sides is a reminder of how conflicts attract outsiders and raises questions about the motives of the protagonists and the contribution they make.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Under the banner of Edmund Burke's quote that, \"</span><span lang=\"EN\">All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing,\" the western fighters spell out their motives in a Facebook post writing that:</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"> \"They will not do nothing while innocent Kurdish men, women and children, Yazidis, Shia and Sunni Muslims, Christians and regional minorities of all kinds are tortured and murdered by Islamic State.\"</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><STRONG><i>Lofty sentiments</i></STRONG><br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Yet, despite such lofty sentiments, the motives that drive someone to <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/04/white-saviours-arabs-syria-libya-201442145225666272.html\" target=\"_blank\">travel abroad to fight in a foreign conflict </a>are as varied and as complex as the participants themselves.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\">Idealism mixed with a romanticised misunderstanding of conflict is, of course, a key factor particularly when there is an ideological backdrop to the conflict. The most famous example of this is the sentimentalised, and much misunderstood, Spanish Civil War which drew thousands of idealistic adventures to both sides.</span></p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN-GB\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">More recently, similar motives led the<a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/15/iraq.features\" target=\"_blank\"> renowned journalist Jason Burke, to join the Kurds in Iraq</a> in their struggle against Saddam Hussein.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN\">\"It was the end of my second year at university and the Gulf War had just finished. I neither wanted to go inter-railing nor work in Waitrose,\" he said in a self-deprecating account of his summer holidays.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Money can be a factor and under the Geneva Convention for a combatant to be classified as a mercenary they must be \"motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain\". Hence reports describing these two Britons as such are mistaken. The likelihood is they would have financed their own journey to northern Syria, bought their own weapons and can only expect basic sustenance in return for their efforts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Combat also draws, as it creates, a handful of psychopaths. One of the key protagonists of the 1972 Northern Ireland Bloody Sunday shooting was the Greek Cypriot Costas Georgiou. After ultimately having been dishonourably discharged from the British army for robbing a post office, he joined the civil war in Angola where he infamously executed his own men before he was, in turn, executed by the victorious People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">(MPLA</span>).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Yet inexplicable as it may seem to many, the mere thrill of combat is often the primary motivating factor. While ideological reasons are cited in justification, the real reason many individuals travel abroad to fight is an age old search of adventure. This more than anything may have played its part in luring westerners to the Kurdish cause, just as others before them went to Bosnia or Rhodesia. The difference being, this time the war against ISIL provides a useful pretext for their actions.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\"><STRONG><i>Personal endeavour</i></STRONG> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Regardless of the motives for joining a foreign conflict, it is ultimately a personal endeavour that rarely brings much benefit to the side whose cause has been adopted particularly, as in this instance, when the numbers involved are so small.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Unless an individual has a specific and sought after set of skills, such as being a doctor, mechanic, engineer or weapons specialist, it is difficult for them to make a significant contribution. Even the expert training former western soldiers might bring to this conflict will be negated by their inability to communicate with their Kurdish counterparts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">The fact is only foreign governments can really help in the fight against ISIL. The coalition air strikes, the equipment being provided by the German government or the large scale training missions currently under discussion between Erbil and the US government, are ultimately of infinite more value than the contribution of individuals. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">That said, the arrival of these westerners alongside the battling YPG is not without benefit. Their presence will undoubtedly raise morale and bring much welcome publicity to the cause, even if this may be offset by ISIL's claims that their fight is now against western invaders. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">For now, the involvement of western fighters on the Kurdish front lines is little more than a news story and counter-narrative to the many thousands of foreigners from across the world who have joined ISIL. If they are to have any effect, then they must hope that their example somehow galvanises thousands of others. Otherwise, their contribution will remain little more than symbolic. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" lang=\"EN\">Crispian Cuss is a former British Army officer who has worked and lived in the Middle East.

        "#cdata-section": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">On Monday, the <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/11/ferguson-jury-decides-indict-policeman-michael-brow-wil-2014112420510371514.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ferguson grand jury ruled that there was no probable cause</a> to bring any charges against Darren Wilson. On August 9, Wilson, a white policeman, shot and killed Michael Brown, while the 18-year-old black teen was walking down the street in Ferguson, Missouri. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">During the 110 days since Brown was pronounced dead, Ferguson has vividly revealed the US' racial faultlines, unveiled its stark, systemic inequities, and showcased to the world the racial sectarianism that still stratifies and segregates people in the US. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"A system cannot fail those it was never built to protect,\" wrote W.E.B. Dubois, indicting structural inequity and exclusion as the very seeds that rear racial segregation. Dubois' US was marred by formal segregation. A segregation that not only marked black and brown Americans as inferior; but relentlessly exposed them to legal processes that vilified their racial identities, and exonerated their assailants. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Exactly 110 years later, Dubois' words have never been more prescient. The thinker's words foretell a divide that continues to fracture the US along racial lines, and exposes its most marginalised communities to structures that continuously persecute - rather than protect - them. Racial inequities on the ground, perpetuated by politics, law and their slanted processes, drive the racial sectarianism that marred the US at its inception, middle and current passages.</span></p>\r\n<p><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">US' tribal divisions</span></i></STRONG></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\"Sectarianism\" may seem both geographically and conceptually foreign to the modern American experience. First, it connotes a primordial and tribal division commonly used to characterise <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/world/middleeast/power-struggles-in-middle-east-exploit-islams-ancient-sectarian-rift.html\" target=\"_blank\">warring factions in the Middle East</a> or the \"Muslim world\". Second, it is a discord and division almost exclusively linked to religion. </span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, if religious rifts are the primary lines of conflict in the Middle East, then the US' ungodly racial divide looms as its most salient spaces of tension and violence, discord and disenfranchisement. Racism historically, and still today, stands as the US' sectarianism.    </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">American sectarianism is nurtured by two complimentary myths. The first holds that, \"racism is individual and aberrational\", stripping political, economic, and legal structures from any responsibility in perpetuating racial inequality. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The second myth contends that these very structures are \"colour-blind and objective systems, which function without racial bias\". Together, these myths not only caricature the meaning of racism, and vastly narrow its scope, but more importantly, conceal how government structures continually reinforce the US' racial sectarianism. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The population of <a class=\"internallink\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/15/how-ferguson-exposes-the-racial-bias-in-local-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">Ferguson is 67 percent black</a>. However, 50 of its 53 policemen, including Wilson, are white. The grand jury, which ultimately decided to bring no charges, comprised <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/grand-jury-in-michael-brown-case-black-members-white/article_6bbba56c-e28a-53d0-8b85-b20c36810fbd.html\" target=\"_blank\">nine whites and three black members</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Ferguson was only demographically a \"black community\". Its political institutions, police force, and grand jury were overwhelmingly white. Therefore, racial division in Ferguson aligned neatly with power disparities, which became blatantly clear when the grand jury rendered a definition of justice that served the interests of one officer, Wilson, instead of the collective concerns of the 14,200 black residents of Ferguson. Blacks simply lived in Ferguson, while whites controlled it.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><STRONG><i>Asymmetrical sectarianism</i></STRONG><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In both its religious and racial form, sectarianism is seldom symmetrical. Typically, one faction holds comparative supremacy within the halls of power, and therefore, manipulates legal processes to its advantage and to the detriment of its rival faction. Popular illustrations of war-torn Arab and Muslim states overwhelmingly centre on the sectarian splits, which consequently simplify the distinct and complicated crises taking place from state to state.</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Yet, American racial hostilities and division is manifested by embedded and still <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">growing racial segregation in virtually every major US city</a>; the consistent assault and erosion of affirmative action by the courts and through the ballot box; an aggregate prison population that is <a class=\"InternalLink\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/tamir-rices-toy-gun-indistinguishable-real-gun-cops/story?id=27137979\" target=\"_blank\">61 percent black and Latino</a>; and police officers that profile, persecute and slay black and brown youth without punishment.     </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">While neatly crafted myths perpetuate a thin veneer of racial harmony, Ferguson offers a sharp dose of the US' unequal reality, which pierces through that veneer to reveal the racial sectarianism that still divides the US. A sectarianism where the most vulnerable are victimised, the racially excluded are vast villains, and the law and its processes are deployed to deepen primordial racial inequities. The nihilism and hopelessness embodied by protesters in Ferguson are, echoing Dubois, bred by a system that continuously strips a people of its dignity.     </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Racial rifts and conflicts continue to fortify US sectarianism. A sectarianism that simultaneously rips this country apart as we gaze eastward, and ridicule distant peoples for their backward, tribal and primal divides - which deters us acknowledging our own sectarian crisis, even as it unfolds in our own back yards and on our televisions.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><STRONG><i><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Khaled A.
